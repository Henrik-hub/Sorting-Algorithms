# Sorting-Algorithms
Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble Sort  Merge sort, Quick sort and sort via lambda

Sorting algorithms are stored in Algorithm folder. 

Desktop App provides GUI to generate random arrays and to apply the different sorting algorithms. The size of array needs to be set from user. Values in the range of 0 to (size_of_array) x 10 are created in an array. After selecting a sorting method, it starts and measures elapsed time of execution(milliseconds).
